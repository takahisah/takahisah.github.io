This is the first time in 7 years that I'll be watching an Apple announcement not as an Apple employee, but as just another Apple fan. As an employee, I really did look forward to the events. Secrecy is a strong part of the culture at Apple (not one that I really agreed with all the time, but will save that for another post), and so heading into the event I wouldn't know too much about what would be announced, but at the same time have a kind of vague idea of what my colleagues are working on based on hallway conversations. The event was the time to say "so that's why he asked me about that!" or "thats why she always had a small black suitcase." There would be rooms reserved for streaming the event, like Cafe Macs or building lobbies, and employees would gather there to cheer along our celebrities like Craig, Tim and Jony. People are also not afraid to showcase the fact that they worked on something, by applauding loudly or just generally making noises with announcements of seemingly small features. Kevin Lynch might say something like, "so now, you can have *different color watchfaces*!" and there would be a small cohort of 5 people in the back of the room screaming their heads off.

The upcoming event is special. It will probably be more important than any of the events that I saw while I was at Apple, because it needs set the tone for the next 10 years to come at Apple. Like I described here, the event is really not just for customers or the media. It's also for the employees and prospective employees. When Tim Cook closes the events with his usual, "thanks to the employees at Apple, I feel so lucky to be working with the smartest minds in the world," that sticks with us. It's a place where the employees will be celebrated and hallway conversations happen about how cool a new feature is, or how we should rewrite iTunes in Swift (jokingly, but there is a radar for that).

So with all that being said, I have a few things I'd like to see in the next event.
- An in depth look at the Apple campus: this will be the home of Apple for decades to come. They have been criticized for designing an open floor plan office, and I feel this would need to be addressed. Even during the time I was there, the software engineers would cringe at the mention of an open office plan.
- A play for VR and AR: ARKit is an awesome start. In past events they act as if NVIDIA just doesn't exist, and I feel that's just not going to fly anymore. What is the VR story, and how are they thinking about this? I think a lot of VR enthusiasts are just discounting Apple now because the hardware is not suiting their needs.
- Doubling down on Swift: what are the plans for using Swift in more places. How about something like "Swift-scripting", where programmers would be able to automate tasks on the phone using Swift?
- A flying Apple car that can be summoned with my Apple Watch that's driven by Siri while I'm watching the next Star Wars on an Apple TV that's built into the car... :) Or an Apple TV with a sane remote controller.
