Greg Kohs is premiering his documentary of AlphaGo at the [Tribeca Film Festival](https://tribecafilm.com/filmguide/alphago-2017). As an avid follower of the ingenious work done by DeepMind, I'm really looking forward to this film. I've read their [Nature paper](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/alphago/AlphaGoNaturePaper.pdf) many times, so am familiar with the technical architecture. It would be great to learn the back story, like how they assembled the team, what kind of work environment they worked in and the hidden challenges they faced during the process.

I watched all of the matches between Lee Sedol and AlphaGo live, and still remember the [reactions by the narrators when AlphaGo made a play during game 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-GsfyVCBu0&feature=youtu.be&t=1h18m13s). Everybody thought was a mistake of some kind, but it turned out to win the match.

It seems like they premier in New York only. Can't wait to see them come to nearby theatres or iTunes.
